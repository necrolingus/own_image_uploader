# 🚀 Own Image Uploader

Spin up this Node.js app in Docker or as a standalone app to to have your own secure mage uploader. 🧪

Have you ever used sites like IMG BB or the like to upload random images to share with others? Now you don't have to! You can host your own simple image uploader! 🥳

The container saves the images in a docker volume, and every 6 hours a job runs to delete images older than what you specified. ❌

There are several parameters you can set to fine tune default storage days, max storage days, rate limiting, etc! 📜

You also set your own secret so that only those who know the secret can upload images! 🤐
